# Play It Forward – Student & Parent Portal

A web-based portal designed for **Play It Forward**, a nonprofit music education organization, to help students, parents, and teachers easily access schedules, assignments, class resources, and updates.

This project extends the organization’s existing WordPress site with a dedicated, login-based portal for families and staff.
